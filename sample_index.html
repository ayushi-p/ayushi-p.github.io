						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/evan_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
							Hello! My name is Evan Velasco. I am a digital analytics professional currently working as a Data Solutions Manager at Instacart. 
							I began my career focused on programmatic data and understanding the complex landscape of ad tech. Since then, I have continued to 
							gain knowledge of digital advertising as a whole. I am an extremely driven individual with a natural curiosity who is always 
							eager to learn something new.</p>

							<h2>My Day Job</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/instacart_logo.jpeg" alt="" /></span> 
								I am currently a Data Solutions Manager at Instacart, where I lead all off-platform and ad-tech initiatives for the 
								Data Solutions team. My responsibilities include overseeing Audience Enablement Operations, Audience Targeting 
								Research & Experimentation, Scaled/Syndicated Audiences, and Audience Refresh Management. By blending my analytical expertise 
								with the engineering capabilities of our Data Solutions developers, our team creates scalable, 
								top-tier solutions that fuel growth in a fast-changing business environment.
							</p>

							<h2>Education</h2>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gt_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a current student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Masters of Science in Analytics. My decision to go back to school 
								was a natural progression as I continued to seek knowledge. I chose the program at Georgia Tech due to its academic 
								rigour and wide array of course choices. I am most interested in learning about the mathematics behind
								modeling algorithms. A few courses I am looking forward to include Optimization, Regression, and High Dimensional Data Analytics.
							</p>


							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ucsd_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a proud graduate of UC San Diego where I received a B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics. 
								The Math-Econ major is very broad and allows for flexibility depending on an individual's 
								interests. I chose to focus my coursework on statistics which introduced me to the field of analytics and data science. 
								I had the pleasure of taking multiple computational statistics courses based in R and data science courses in Python. I paired my applied statistical courses with rigorous mathematical theory, including multiple courses in real analysis.
								My degree formed a strong foundation which I continue to build upon through self studying and professional experience.

							<h2>Interests</h2>

							<h4>Currently Studying:</h4>
							<p>
								<b>Data and Visual Analytics:</b> This course explores a wide range of techniques and tools for analyzing and visualizing data at scale. It focuses on integrating computational methods with visualization strategies to enable effective data analysis. What most excites me about this course is to learn more about technologies such as Scala, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform. Additionally, I am looking forward to working in javascript and building interactive visualizations using D3.<br>
							</p>

							<h4>Industry Topics:</h4>
							<p>Within the ads industry I have a wide array of interests ranging from programmatic auction mechanisms to first party data solutions. In 2025 I am most excited to learn more about leveraging data cleanrooms for measurement and data collaberation in ad tech. 
							</p>

							<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
							<p>Outside of my professional work, I love cooking (currently mastering the art of soup), baseball, and exploring Washington DC's countless historical sites. You will also catch me at the dog park with my small (but mighty) pup.</p>
